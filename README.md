Welcome to Celia Gutiérrez website!

Hi! My name is Celia and I´m an Adalaber on my way to be a great front-end developer!

This is my first project that is part of my Adalab curriculum. 
The goal was to create a responsive website with different partials based on some directives given by Adalab. The website consist of four modules with some functions and interactions as transitions, animations and link buttons (external links or for surfing the web), and make the layout using Flexbox and Grid.

Technical resources:
I,ve used HTLM5 and SASS (SCSS) automated by Gulp. 

The website:
It is structure as follows:

   - Header:
      The whole header is an image of a city with a button that shows a "hamburguer menu" fixed in the top left square that do not dissapear if you scroll. The h1 is placed here, in the center of the viewport. There is another  anchor button that links with the third module. For the layout I´ve used Flexbox.

   - Main:
      Is a little paragraph with an external link button with a hover size and color function. The layout is made with Flexbox as well.

   - Aside:
      It has an h2 title and three paragraphs laid out by Grid. There is an external link button with a hover color function.

   - Footer
      The main menu (the nav) is placed here with a list of different stages. There is a second menu that is a list of social media links. As well we can find a little paragraph with an icon and an anchor button with an animation that link with de first module. The layout is made with Flexbox.

The website considers the accessibility, so it has titles, aria labels and "alt" atribute for images as well.

I hope you enjoy the website!! 

Thank for visiting!
